Concentric circles show $n = 1$ (innermost, dark blue), $n = 2$ (cyan), $n = 3$ (green), $n = 4$ (light green). Each shell corresponds to a distinct energy level with $E_n \propto -1/n^2$. The radial extent scales as $\langle r \rangle \propto n^2$, so outer shells are progressively more diffuse. The number of radial nodes in the wave function equals $n - l - 1$, reflecting the nested structure. This coordinate measures the "depth" of the partition in the energy hierarchy. \textbf  {(B)} Angular complexity coordinate $l$ (azimuthal quantum number) represents the boundary shape. Four shapes shown: $l = 0$ (s-orbital, blue circle, spherically symmetric, no angular nodes), $l = 1$ (p-orbital, magenta dumbbell, one nodal plane), $l = 2$ (d-orbital, red cloverleaf, two nodal planes), $l = 3$ (f-orbital, orange complex shape, three nodal planes). The number of angular nodes equals $l$, and the angular momentum magnitude is $L = \sqrt  {l(l+1)}\hbar $. Higher $l$ corresponds to more complex phase space topology and higher rotational kinetic energy. This coordinate measures the "shape complexity" of the partition boundary. \textbf  {(C)} Orientation coordinate $m$ (magnetic quantum number) represents the spatial direction of the angular momentum vector. Shown for $l = 2$ (d-orbital): five possible orientations $m \in \{-2, -1, 0, +1, +2\}$, depicted as vectors pointing in different directions from a central nucleus (blue dot). Each orientation corresponds to a different projection of angular momentum along the quantization axis (typically chosen as $z$-axis): $L_z = m\hbar $. In the absence of external fields, all $m$ states have the same energy (degeneracy). An external magnetic field breaks this degeneracy (Zeeman effect), with energy shifts $\Delta E = m \mu _B B$. This coordinate measures the "orientation" of the partition in space. \textbf  {(D)} Chirality coordinate $s$ (spin quantum number) represents boundary handedness. Two possible values: $s = +1/2$ (spin-up, red arrow pointing up) and $s = -1/2$ (spin-down, blue arrow pointing down). This is an intrinsic topological property of the partition boundary, not related to spatial rotation. The spin angular momentum magnitude is $S = \sqrt  {s(s+1)}\hbar = \sqrt  {3}/2 \hbar $, with $z$-component $S_z = s\hbar = \pm \hbar /2$. Spin-up and spin-down states have opposite magnetic moments: $\mu _s = \pm g_s \mu _B/2$, where $g_s \approx 2$ is the spin g-factor. This coordinate measures the "handedness" or "chirality" of the partition. \textbf  {(E)} Geometric constraints on partition coordinates. The complete coordinate specification is the 4-tuple $(n, l, m, s)$ with constraints: $n \geq 1$ (positive integer, partition depth), $l \in \{0, 1, \ldots  , n-1\}$ (angular complexity bounded by depth), $m \in \{-l, -l+1, \ldots  , +l-1, +l\}$ (orientation bounded by complexity, $2l+1$ values), $s \in \{-1/2, +1/2\}$ (chirality has two values). These constraints arise from the geometry of bounded phase space and ensure that partition coordinates form a consistent labeling system. \textbf  {(F)} Shell capacity formula $C(n) = 2n^2$ showing the maximum number of electrons that can occupy shell $n$. Bar chart shows: $n=1$ (blue, $C=2$), $n=2$ (cyan, $C=8$), $n=3$ (green, $C=18$), $n=4$ (teal, $C=32$), $n=5$ (light green, $C=50$). The factor of 2 comes from spin degeneracy ($s = \pm 1/2$), and the $n^2$ comes from the number of $(l,m)$ pairs: $\DOTSB \sum@ \slimits@ _{l=0}^{n-1}(2l+1) = n^2$. This formula explains the periodic table structure: periods have lengths 2, 8, 8, 18, 18, 32, 32, \ldots  , corresponding to filling shells in order of energy. The capacity formula is a direct consequence of partition coordinate constraints and the exclusion principle (no two electrons can have identical coordinates). Together, these six panels define the complete partition coordinate system $(n, l, m, s)$ that labels all possible electron states in atoms and molecules.

(A) Partition lag distributions: gases have fast, narrow distributions (free flight between collisions); liquids have intermediate distributions (cage rattling); viscous fluids have slow, broad distributions (extended phase-lock reconfiguration). The distribution shape encodes fluid rheology. (B) Temperature dependence: $\langle \tau _p\rangle \propto \sqrt {m/(k_B T)}$ for gases (kinetic theory); $\langle \tau _p\rangle \propto \exp (E_a/k_B T)$ for liquids (Arrhenius activation). This explains the opposite temperature dependence of viscosity in gases (increases) vs liquids (decreases). (C) Collision vs uncertainty limits: $\tau _p = \max (\tau _{\text {coll}}, \hbar /\Delta E)$. In gases, collisions limit completion; in quantum systems, uncertainty limits completion. (D) Pressure dependence: $\tau _p \propto P^{-1/2}$ at fixed temperature---higher pressure increases collision frequency, reducing partition lag. This explains pressure-viscosity coupling in gases}{figure.4}{}}
